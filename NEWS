Version 0.5.0 (2010-11-22):

  * PDF export finished into a usable state for all generic content elements
    (this also includes a major refactor of export the mechanism).
 
  * Restrict the condition evaluation namespace in `MacroParser' (sucurity fix).

  * Class `SectionContainer' deprecated in favor of `Container' which now
    handles sections transparently.

  * Support for embedding YouTube and Vimeo videos.

  * Deprecate `Container' argument `id' in favour of `name'.

  * Allow overriding the default lists of stylesheets and scripts within HTML
    head export.

  * Tables now allow more flexible structures of cells and headings and
    structured text parser now autodetects column headers and cell alignment.

  * Bug fixes.

  * Translation updates.

Version 0.4.0 (2010-01-21):

  * Added support for video embedding
   
  * Audio embedding generalized.

  * Macro parser resurrected and improved (backwards incompatible).

  * Allow explicit image sizing in structured text.

  * Documentation additions.

  * Translation updates.
	
Version 0.3.7 (2009-09-21):

  * Minor API extensions.

  * Bug fixes.

  * Documentation additions and improvements.

  * New translations: de, es, it, no, sk

Version 0.3.6 (2007-11-05)

  * Removed all files specific to e-learning (exercises etc.).

  * New i18n classes for locale-formatted decimal and monetary
    amounts.

  * New interface for locale data definition.

  * `Reader' API cleaning and stabilization.

  * Generate all language variants in one pass.

Version 0.3.5 (2007-08-10):

  * Removed all files specific to the Eurochance project.

  * Major API changes: Final separation of ContentNode representation and
    document structure processing from source files (new Reader classes).
    Output format generators can now be overriden within the Exporter class.
    Generalized resource constructions process.

  * New convenience functions for content construction.

  * Minor improvements in the markup formatter.
	
  * Improved navigation within statically generated html pages.

	
Version 0.3.4 (2006-12-04):

  * Improved HTML generation features.

  * Many new features in the internationalization API.  There is a new
    `LocalizableDateTime' class for locale specific date/time conversions.
    `TranslatableText' and `Concatenation' classes are now unicode subclasses.
    See the API documentation for more details.

  * Most of the export related functionality was now moved to the exporter
    classes from the content classes.  This increases abstraction of the
    content and allows more control for custom exporter classes.  The related
    APIs have changed, but these changes are hidden when using the end user
    tools.

  * Added Polish translations including the formatting manual (thanks to Pawel
    Loba).
	
Version 0.3.3 (2006-07-28): 

  * Added defered translation support to allow dynamic translation at the
    export time.  This change lead to a major rewrite of the export part and
    internal text processing, but should not lead to any incompatibilities
    except those described below.
  
  * The output language is now not set using the `LCG_LANGUAGE' environment
    variable (which only allowed to set the language once for one process), but
    using the `lang' argument of the exporter.  This change is reflected by the
    user tools (lcgmake and generate), so should not be notifiable if you don't
    use the API directly.
  
  * Back-references from section titles to the table of contents were
    fixed. They accidently stoped to work under certain conditions sometimes
    before the 0.3 version.


Version 0.3.2 (2006-07-25): 

  * This is an API cleanup version.  There are no new features or data format
    incompatibilities, but there are major API changes.
    
  * The content was finally made independent of the node.  Thus it is possible
    to construct the content separately and assign it to a `ContentNode'
    instance later.  In consequence, `Content' and all the derived classes take
    no `parent' argument now.
    
  * Much of the export related functionality was moved from the `ContentNode'
    class and some `Content' subclasses to the Exporter.
    
  * The import ralated functionality was also moved away from `ContentNode' and
    concentrated into derived classes.  This is an intemediate solution before
    creating a separate import layer.
	

Version 0.3.1 (2006-05-22):

  * Internal dealing with secondary language was made a generic feature, rather
    than a hack just for the Eurochance course.

  * Language selection was also made a generic feature.  It appears
    automatically when multiple versions of the document exist.

  * Added Czech, Spanish, Norwegian and Slovak translations of some
    LCG generated texts.

  * Internal cleanup.
	
  * Added a hack to prevent some MSIE versions from displaying the Media Player
    window over the page text.
	
  * Include the navigation bar in the output only when there is more than one
    page.
	

Version 0.3 (2006-04-12):

  * This is the first public version, which was released at the occassion of
    releasing the Eurochance language courses (see
    http://eurochance.brailcom.org), which are generated by the LCG.

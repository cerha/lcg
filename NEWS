	Version 0.3.3

	Added defered translation support to allow dynamic translation at the
	export time.  This change lead to a major rewrite of the export part
	and other internals, but should not lead to any incompatibilities
	except those described below.

	The output language is now not set using the `LCG_LANGUAGE' environment
	variable (which only allowed to set the language once for one process),
	but using the `lang' argument of the exporter.  This change is
	reflected by the user tools (lcgmake and generate), so should not be
	notifiable if you don't use the API directly.

	* BUGFIX: Back-references from section titles to the table of
	contents were fixed.  They accidently stoped to work under certain
	conditions sometimes before the 0.3 version.

	Version 0.3.2

	This is an API cleanup version.  There are no new features or data
	format incompatibilities, but there are major API changes.

	The content was finally made independent of the node.  Thus it is
	possible to construct the content separately and assign it to a
	`ContentNode' instance later.  In consequence, `Content' and all the
	derived classes take no `parent' argument now.

	Also much of the export related functionality was moved from the
	`ContentNode' class and some `Content' subclasses to the Exporter.

	The import ralated functionality was also moved away from
	`ContentNode' and concentrated into the derived classes.  This is an
	intemediate solution before creating a separate import layer.

	Version 0.3.1

	Internal dealing with secondary language was made a generic
	feature, rather than a hack just for the Eurochance course.

	Language selection was also made a generic feature.  It appears
	automatically when multiple versions of the document exist.

	Added Czech, Spanish, Norwegian and Slovak translations of some
	LCG generated texts.

	Some internal cleanup.
	
	* BUGFIX: Added a hack to prevent some MSIE versions from
	displaying the Media Player window over the pagee text.
	
	* BUGFIX: Include the navigation bar in the output only when there
	is more than one page.
	

2006-04-12  Tomas Cerha  <cerha@brailcom.org>

	Version 0.3

	This is the first public version, which was released at the occassion
	of releasing the Eurochance language courses (see
	http://eurochance.brailcom.org), which are generated by the
	LCG.

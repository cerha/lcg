2007-11-05  Tomas Cerha  <cerha@brailcom.org>

	Version 0.3.6

	Removed all files specific to e-learning (exercises etc.).

	New i18n classes for locale-formatted decimal and monetary
	amounts.

	New interface for locale data definition.

	`Reader' API cleaning and stabilization.

	Generate all language variants in one pass.

2007-08-10  Tomas Cerha  <cerha@brailcom.org>

	Version 0.3.5

	Removed all files specific to the Eurochance project.

	Major API changes: Final separation of ContentNode representation
	and document structure processing from source files (new Reader
	classes).  Output format generators can now be overriden within
	the Exporter class.  Generalized resource constructions process.

	Many new convenience functions for content construction.

	Minor improvements in the markup formatter.
	
	Improved navigation within statically generated html pages.

	
2006-12-04  Tomas Cerha  <cerha@brailcom.org>

	Version 0.3.4

	Added Polish translations for generated content and formatting
	manual (thanks to Pawel Loba).
	
	Improved HTML generation features.

	Many new features in the internationalization API.  There is a new
	`LocalizableDateTime' class for locale specific date/time
	conversions.  `TranslatableText' and `Concatenation' classes are
	now unicode subclasses.  See the API documentation for more
	details.

	Most of the export related functionality was now moved to the
	exporter classes from the content classes.  This increases
	abstraction of the content and allows more control for custom
	exporter classes.  The related APIs have changed, but these
	changes are hidden when using the end user tools.

2006-07-28  Tomas Cerha  <cerha@brailcom.org>

	Version 0.3.3

	Added defered translation support to allow dynamic translation at
	the export time.  This change lead to a major rewrite of the
	export part and internal text processing, but should not lead to
	any incompatibilities except those described below.

	The output language is now not set using the `LCG_LANGUAGE' environment
	variable (which only allowed to set the language once for one process),
	but using the `lang' argument of the exporter.  This change is
	reflected by the user tools (lcgmake and generate), so should not be
	notifiable if you don't use the API directly.

	* BUGFIX: Back-references from section titles to the table of
	contents were fixed.  They accidently stoped to work under certain
	conditions sometimes before the 0.3 version.
	

2006-07-25  Tomas Cerha  <cerha@brailcom.org>

	Version 0.3.2

	This is an API cleanup version.  There are no new features or data
	format incompatibilities, but there are major API changes.

	The content was finally made independent of the node.  Thus it is
	possible to construct the content separately and assign it to a
	`ContentNode' instance later.  In consequence, `Content' and all the
	derived classes take no `parent' argument now.

	Much of the export related functionality was moved from the
	`ContentNode' class and some `Content' subclasses to the Exporter.

	The import ralated functionality was also moved away from
	`ContentNode' and concentrated into derived classes.  This is an
	intemediate solution before creating a separate import layer.
	

2006-05-22  Tomas Cerha  <cerha@brailcom.org>

	Version 0.3.1

	Internal dealing with secondary language was made a generic
	feature, rather than a hack just for the Eurochance course.

	Language selection was also made a generic feature.  It appears
	automatically when multiple versions of the document exist.

	Added Czech, Spanish, Norwegian and Slovak translations of some
	LCG generated texts.

	Some internal cleanup.
	
	* BUGFIX: Added a hack to prevent some MSIE versions from
	displaying the Media Player window over the page text.
	
	* BUGFIX: Include the navigation bar in the output only when there
	is more than one page.
	

2006-04-12  Tomas Cerha  <cerha@brailcom.org>

	Version 0.3

	This is the first public version, which was released at the occassion
	of releasing the Eurochance language courses (see
	http://eurochance.brailcom.org), which are generated by the
	LCG.

#if issubclass(type, SentenceCompletion)

The aim of this exercise is to provide an opportunity for the user to produce a
complete sentence and compare pronunciation with the original and is therefore
purely aural-oral, with no written tasks.

If you wish to check your answers against the written text, you can see the
textual transcript of the recording.  Since this is not a written exercise,
there is no way to check your results automatically.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, Reading)

Read the text in this exercise.  The information from the text will be used in
the following exercises.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, Listening)

Listen to the recording carefully.  The information will be used in the
following exercises.

#endif

#if issubclass(type, MultipleChoiceQuestions)

Each question in this exercise is followed by a list of possible answers
labaled a, b and c.  Only one answer is correct.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, Selections)

There are several groups (usually pairs or triples) of similar sentences or
expressions, however only one sentence in each group is correct.  Your
goal is to decide which one it is.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, TrueFalseStatements)

Each sentence in this exercise is followed by two controls labeled 'TRUE' and
'FALSE'.  Your goal is to decide whether the sentence is true or not and press
the corresponding button.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, GapFilling)

Your goal is to choose the correct word to fill in a gap in a sentence.  For
each gap you have several choices.  Only one of them is correct.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, _ChoiceBasedExercise)

You will hear a response immediately after choosing the answer.  When you
decide for a wrong answer, you can try again until you find the correct one.
The results below the exercise will show you how many answers you did right on
the first try (see the [#indicators] section below).

#if issubclass(type, VocabExercise)

There are two ways how you can do the exercise: The oral form and the written
form.  Do both of them for best results.

The oral form is simple.  Go through the items below and think of a correct
translation for each term.  There is a >>Play<< button behind the text-box for
each item which allows you to hear the correct answer.  Repeat the answer to
practise correct pronunciation.  Since there is no way how to check your oral
answers, the results are not available.  If you want to see your score, you
must do the written form.

To do the written form, simply write down the translation of each item into the
text-box.  Pay special attention to use capital letters, where appropriate,
since an answer without correct capitalization is always considered incorrect.
When the prompt is a complete sentence, you must also take care of correct
punctuation.  


#endif
#if issubclass(type, Transformation)

Your goal is to transform a structure (pattern or paradigm) into a different
structure.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, Substitution)

Use the prompt to produce another sentence with the same structure.  Each
sentence is followed by text in brackets.  Replace the corresponding part of
the sentence using this text.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, _Cloze)

Your goal in this exercise is to fill in the gaps in a longer piece of text.
There is just one correct answer for each gap.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, Dictation)

First listen to the recording once and then go to the large text entry box
below.  Within the box, you can use shortcut keys to replay individual pieces
of the recording.  Typically you always play one piece using the *>* key (right
angle bracket) and write down what you hear.  Then you press the *>* key again
to replay the next part and write it down again until you reach the end of the
recording.  Then you can use the evaluation keys (or the buttons below) to
evaluate the whole text.

Pay special attention to punctuation and case, since they often cause most of
the problems when evaluating your answer.  Write all the sentences as you hear
them, using the appropriate punctuation character and one space after each
sentence.  No space is allowed at after the last sentence.

/Note:/ Of course, you can replay the recording how many times you need to
understand it, however two attempts should be enough for a well performing
student.

#else
#if issubclass(type, _FillInExercise)

You can check each answer individually using the shortcut keys (see the section
[#keys] for more information).  When your answer is evaluated as incorrect and
you do not know why, always check whether you have correct punctuation and
capital letters where appropriate, since these two things tend to cause most
confusion.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, _InteractiveExercise) 

Use the [#panel] at the bottom of the exercise
to evaluate all the answers.

#endif
#if issubclass(type, _FillInExercise)

If your browser doesn't support JavaScript, the interactive features and
automatic evaluation do not work.  You can still use this course, but you will
have to check your answers against the [#answer-sheets] manually.

#if issubclass(type, _FillInExercise)

== Shortcut Keys == keys

In all the exercises where you fill in the text into a text-box you can use the
two shortcut keys described below.


Enter
   Use this key within the text-field to evaluate the current answer.  You hear
   a sound response and in case of an error, the cursor is moved to the
   position of the first incorrect character within the text.  This way you can
   locate the error, fix it and evaluate again.  When you don't know how to
   fix an error, you can use the ``hint'' key described below.

Ctrl-Space
   This function is called a ``hint''.  It helps you in case you don't know the
   answer or you don't know how to fix an error in your answer.  Just press the
   key combination (holding the Ctrl key, press the spacebar) and one letter of
   the correct answer will be filled in automatically.  If you have already
   entered some text, the cursor will be moved behind the last correct
   character and next one will be inserted.  It also means, that if there is
   some text behind the cursor, there is at least one error in it.  Try to
   locate this error and correct it.  Then you can try to evaluate your answer
   using the 'Enter' key (see above) or use ``hint'' again, until you find the
   complete answer.

#if issubclass(type, Dictation)

Morover, within the dictation exercise text box, you can also use the following
keys to control the playback of the recording:

> /(right angle bracket, greater than sign)/
   Play next piece of the recording.

< /(left angle bracket, less than sign)/
   Play the previous piece of the recording.
  
Ctrl-Enter
   Replay the current (last played) piece of the recording once again.

#endif

#if issubclass(type, _InteractiveExercise)

== Indicators == indicators

The indicator panel below the exercise shows the following values:

#if issubclass(type, Dictation)

>>Result<<
   Displays the result of the last evaluation (evaluate your answer by pressing
   the 'Enter' key or by the >>Evaluate<< button below the exercise).

#else

>>Result<<
   Displays the number and percentage of successful answers.  The first pair of
   numbers shows the results of all current answers.  If you didn't answer all
   of them correctly on first attempt, there is also a second pair of numbers
   showing how many answers you did succesfuly on the first try.  Use the
   >>Reset<< button to start again.

>>Answered<<
   Displays the number of the tasks you have already answered.  For example the
   value 4/10 means, that you have answered four out of ten questions.  Thus
   you should finish the remaining six.

#endif

== Control Panel == panel

The control panel below the exercise contains the following buttons:

>>Evaluate<<
   Evaluate the entire exercise.  If an error is found, the cursor is moved to
   the first incorrect answer.  Within a text-box, the cursor is also moved to
   the first incorrect character of your answer.

>>Fill<<
   Fill in the whole exercise with correct answers.

>>Reset<<
   Reset all your answers and start again.

== Answer Sheets == answer-sheets

Answer Sheets contain all the correct answers for all exercises.  You can
access Answer Sheets from the Course Index, or more conveniently, you can use
the '?'  (question mark) link behind every task.  This link leads you directly
to the corresponding answer in the Answer Sheet.

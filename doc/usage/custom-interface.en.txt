= The Custom Interface =

The Custom LCG Interface becomes handy, when you want to have some more control
over the processing of your data.  Here are a few examples:

  * Reading the input data from other than the supported sources.
  * Imposing further restrictions (integrity checking etc).
  * Implementing a custom (eg. a fixed) structure.
  * Customizing the output (for appearance, accessibility etc.).

Creating a custom interface is in practise a matter of Python coding.  You will
most likely derive your own classes from the standard LCG classes, implementing
any special handling and you will use these classes to process your data.

A reasonable knowledge of the LCG API is needed when you want to create Custom
LCG Interfaces.  The LCG classes are documented within their Python docstrings.
Use pydoc to view the documentation or read the source code itself.  See the
[http://www.freebsoft.org/lcg LCG Project Homepage] for more information how to
get LCG source code.

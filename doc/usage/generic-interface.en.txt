= The Generic Interface =

The /Generic Interface/ is the simplest way to use the LCG.  It is ideal for
documents with a hierarchical structure, such as manuals, help systems and
simple e-learning courses.  When the format described below doesn't suit your
needs, consider using [custom-interface].

The /Generic Interface/ is implemented with the =lcgmake.py= program, which
comes with the LCG.  This program processes a directory containing the source
data and produces the result in one of the supported formats.  The details
about how to specify the output format and how to influence the process of
generation are described when the program is launched with the =--help=
argument like this:

-----
lcgmake.py --help

= Using LCG =

LCG can be used in two different ways:

  * [generic-interface] doesn't require any coding.  You simply create the
    input data in the form described in this manual, run LCG to process your
    data and you get the output in one of the supported output formats.

  * [custom-interface] can be used when the generic interface doesn't fit your
    needs.  You can for example read the input data out of a database or any
    other source, you can verify the validity and integrity of the input data
    and impose further restrictions, or you can customize the output format.
    The customizations are done using the Python programming language.

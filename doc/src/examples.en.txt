== Compilation of simple document structure ==

Generating LCG documentation may be used as an example of using LCG to generate
HTML output from a directory containing LCG source files controlled by
=index.txt= file.

Execute it using
----
python -m lcg.make doc/src doc/html
---
in the LCG source tree.

== Basic reader and usage ==

/LCG Reader/ can read source data and construct document structure dynamically
in Python code.  You can find an example of definition and usage of /LCG
Reader/ using the =index.py= file in =doc/examples/reader=.  The example
also shows how to override some LCG behavior.

Examine =doc/examples/reader/src/index.py= and execute using
----
python -m lcg.make doc/examples/reader/src doc/examples/reader/html
----

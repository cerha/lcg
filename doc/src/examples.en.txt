=== Compilation of simple document structure ===

The target /doc/ in Makefile of this package presents a basic example
of how to use lcgmake to generate HTML output from a directory
containing LCG files (including the index.txt file).

Execute it using 'make doc' in the LCG source tree.

=== Basic reader and usage ===

In \/doc/examples/lcgmake-basic-reader you can find an example of how
to define and use a basic LCG Reader using the /index.py/ file, which
you can use as a template to override some of LCG behavior.

Execute lcgmake-basic-reader/example.sh and examine also
lcgmake-basic-reader/src/index.py .

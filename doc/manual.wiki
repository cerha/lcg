= Learning Content Generator Manual =

Tomas Cerha, 2004-05-19

This document describes the formats of data used on the input side of the
Learning Content Generator.  This data are then processed by the LCG.  The
result is an IMS compatible content package that can be used with any IMS
compliant Learning Management System.

*Table of Contents:*

@TOC@

== Motivation == *

The LCG makes it possible to generate the content package using any output
format without changing the input data and thus makes the content and
presentation two independent issues.

To be able to process the input data with a computer program (the LCG) we must
define the rules how this data are represented.  The computer program must be
able to recognize the logical elements of the content to be able to put them
together on its output, but on the other hand the content creators must not be
forced to deal with the technical aspects more than necessary.


== Basic Structure == *

The basic concept is based on files arranged into directories (folders)
according to the logical structure of the course (as defined
[structure.wiki|here]).

There is one /base directory/ for the whole course.  This directory contains
one /subdirectory/ for each unit of the course.  Each of these subdirectories
contains files and subdirectories defining the content of the sections within
the unit.  The input format for each section is different, depending on the
type of the concent used within the section.  Later sections of this document
describe the format of each part individually.

Now, let's get back to the structure of units.  The subdirectories can be named
arbitrarily.  The only important thing is that the units will ordered according
to the alphabetical order of the names of their directories.  Thus it is
advisable to prefix the names by a number of the unit and then any name
describing the focus of the lesson for better orientation.

*An example of the recommended naming scheme of the subdirectories:*

 01-telephoning
 02-office-admin
 03-financial
 04-hotels
 05-tourism
 ...

== Text Sections == *

According to the [structure.wiki|course structure], there are four types of
sections comprising a structured text content.  For each of these sections, the
LCG will expect one text file in the subdirectory of each unit.  The following
table shows the name of the input file for each of the text sections.

| Section          | File |
| Introduction     | intro.txt |
| Key language use | use.txt |
| Key Grammar      | grammar.txt |
| Consolidation    | consolidation.txt |

The input text files use Wiki formatting.  This is a very simple and
straightforward set of rules how to format the plain text to mark the logical
structure of chapters, paragraphs, itemized lists etc.  A brief description
follows.

=== Paragraphs === *

A paragraph is each continual set of rows of text.  Whenever you leave a blank
line, you start a new paragraph.  The line-breaks within the paragraph are
ignored, since the paragraph will be reformatted to fit into the output media.

It is recommended to wrap the paragraphs not to exceed 80 characters in width.
This means that no single character should be found beyond the 79th column.

=== Itemized Lists === *

Itemized lists are marked by an asterisk at the beginning of each item.  The
indentation determines the level in the hierarchy.  First level items are
indented by two spaces, second level by four etc.

*Exapmple:*

 This is a normal paragraph.  The itemized list follows.

   * deer
     * doe
     * elk
     * caribou
   * fish
     * salmon
     * trout
     * haddock
   * birds
     * swallow
     * eagle


Other formatting rules will be added to the manual when we realize thay are
necessary...


== Vocabulary == *

Vocabulary is defined in one Excel (XLS) spreadsheet file for each unit.  The
file contains one vocabulary item per row. 

The first column contains the piece of vocabulary itself.  Second column may
contain the notes, such as (v) for verb, Br/Am for British/American expression
etc.  It is in the competence of content creators to establish a convention for
writing the notes.

The third and further columns contain the translations in the following order:

* Czech
* Slovak
* German
* Norwegian
* Spanish

The translations will be added gradually, so only first and second column is
mandatory.


== Exercises == *

Exercises will often depend on external media files and other data, so all the
definition is located in a subdirectory named ``=exercises=''.

The main specification file is named ``=exercises.txt=''.  Thus the example of
full path of an exercise specification file can be
``=intermediate/03-financial/exercises/exercises.txt=''.





== Sound Recordings == *

All sounds should be recorded digitally in the WAVe format with CD quality.
This means in particular:

* Two channels (stereo)
* Sampling frequency 44.1 kHz
* 16 bits per sample.

These source data will be converted into an applicable output format in
reasonable quality by the technical group.

Each logical piece should be recorded as a separate file except for vocabulary,
since recording one very short file per one vocab item would be too difficult
and time consuming.

Vocabulary should be recorded into one file per unit.  There should be distinct
pauses between individual vocabulary items (one or two seconds).  These
recordings will be cut into pieces automatically.

All other recordings should be recorded separately -- one file per logical
unit.  For instance there will be one file for each listenning exercise etc.


The data should be burned on a CD when ready and sent to the technical group,
since it will be probably too large for transmission via the Internet.

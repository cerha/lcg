= Input Data Formats =

To be able to process the input data with a computer program (the LCG) we must
define a set of rules how this data are represented.  This chapter describes
the data formats currently used by the LCG.

All LCG source files are text files.  Thus you can edit them using any text
editor.  A simple editor, such as Notepad in MS Windows should do the job.  LCG
accepts UTF-8 as the default encoding of the source data, so you should be able
to save your files in this encoding.

LCG also supports other data types within the content, such as sound and video
files, images, scripts, stylesheets etc., but these are not considered /source
files/ from this point of view.  They are called /resources/ in this manual.
To include such files, you usually refer to them from the source files, so you
will also find the relavant information in the later sections.

The following data formats are being used: @NodeIndex(1)@

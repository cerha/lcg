=== Vocabulary === vocabulary

Vocabulary lists are -- quite obviously -- designed for a language course.
Let's suppose we make a course of English language for Spanish learners.

Each vocabulary file consists of word pairs -- the original term and the
translation.  Each pair is on a separate line.  The line starts with the
original term (in English according to the example).  The term may be followed
by a note in round brackets.  The translation follows after the separator "::"
- a double colon.  Blank characters (spaces, tabs) before and after the
separator and at the beginning and end of the line are ignored.

Example (for the English/Spanish course):

-----
busy :: ocupado
call :: llamada 
cell-phone (U.S.) :: teléfono celular
-----

All lines beginning with a hash "#" are comments (ignored).

Sometimes the vocabulary defines also phrases.  The LCG needs to be able to
recognise phrases (they are listed separately).  The phrases can be defined in
one file with "ordinary" vocabulary but must be marked.  

You can either put all the phrases together after a line containing a special
comment "#phrases":

-----
Could you repeat that please? (phr.) :: ¿Podría repitir, por favor? 
to switch off :: apagar
tone :: señal
yellow pages :: páginas amarillas
# phrases
Can I speak to ..? :: ¿Puedo hablar con ... ?
Can I help you? :: ¿Puedo ayudarle?
Can I take a message? :: ¿Puedo tomar algún recado?
-----

Optionally a phrase can be marked using the ``(phr.)'' note at the end of the
phrase like that:

-----
Could you repeat that please? :: ¿Podría repitir, por favor? 
-----

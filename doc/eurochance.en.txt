= Eurochance Course Implementation =


The Eurochance language course (see http://eurochance.brailcom.org) was the
initial implementation of a course using the LCG framework.  Thus the LCG
sources contain an implementation of the Eurochance course structure in a
separate module.  This can serve as an example for creation of other projects
with the LCG.

This document includes the description of the course structure for Eurochance
courses as well as a guide for input data creation.

Note, that the course structure implementation mentioned above (a Python code)
is not all what you need to generate the Eurochance course.  You will also need
the source data.  Since both, the code and the data, have a free license, you
can get them both and try how the LCG works.  Visit the project webpage for
more details.

== Course Structure Specification ==

=== The Intermediate Course Structure ===

The Intermediate Course consists of 15 units.  Each unit is focused on a
certain topic (e.g. finance, catering etc.).  The structure of each unit is
described below in the section [#unit].

The course starts at a Course Index page.  This page contains a short
introduction text and a table of contents.  The first document in the table of
contents is [#instructions].  The 15 units follow.  Then there is a
[#grammar-bank], [#vocabulary-index] and [#help-index].


==== General Course Instructions ==== instructions

The first document linked form the table of contents id called General Course
Instructions and contains basic information about the course, its usage,
navigation etc.


==== Unit Structure ==== unit

The structure of each unit is uniform.  The first section is "Aims and
Objectives".  It informs you briefly about the focus of the unit and lists the
grammar points which will be practised, with links to the [#grammar-bank].

The next section contains a listing of vocabulary for the unit.  You can browse
through the vocabulary, see the translations and play native speaker recordings
to hear the correct pronunciation.

Five sections of exercises follow:
  * Section 1: Vocabulary Practice
  * Section 2: Listening Comprehension
  * Section 3: General Comprehension
  * Section 4: Grammar Practice
  * Section 5: Consolidation

There is a predefined set of exercise types that can be used.  The type, order
and number of exercises in each section is not strictly fixed, however it is as
consistent as possible for easier orientation of the user.

The detailed description of exercise types can be found in the section
[data-formats#exercise-types].

The final section, "Checklist", lists the skills that the user has practised
and should have acquired.

==== Grammar Bank ==== grammar-bank

Apart from the 15 units there is also a Grammar Bank that the learners can use
for study or reference.

The grammar bank consists of a number of sections focused on different topics.
These sections can be linked directly from any unit.  A hierarchical table of
contents is generated automatically at the beginning of the page to allow
direct access to any topic.


==== Vocabulary Index ==== vocabulary-index

This is simply a collection of all the vocabulary from all units sorted
albhabetically by the original term and also by the translation.  Phrases are
listed separately.

The vocabulary index is generated automatically by the LCG, so no source data
are needed.


==== Answer Sheets ==== answer-sheets

Answer Sheets contain all the correct answers for all exercises.  You can
access Answer Sheets from the Course Index, or more conveniently, you can use
the '?'  (question mark) link behind every task within the exercises.  This
link leads you directly to the corresponding answer in the Answer Sheet.

The answer sheets are generated automatically by the LCG and no source data are
needed.


==== Help Index ==== help-index

The Help Index simply lists all the exercise types used within the course and
provides links to their help pages.  Every exercise within the course has its
own link to the respective help page, but it may be practical to have a
collection somewhere...

The help texts are part of the LCG, so no source data are needed.


=== The Advanced Course Structure ===

The Advanced course consists of 10 units.  Their structure is more flexible.
The First and last section is the same (the "Aims & Objectives" and the
"Checklist") as in the Intermediate course.  All the other sections contain
exercises, however their titles and focus is not fixed as in the Intermediate
Course.

There is no separate "Vocabulary" section.  The learners are supposed to use a
dictionary when they discover a new word or expression.

Also the Grammar Bank is omitted for the advanced level.  There are short
explanations before many exercises as the grammar points are being practised.

The top level structure is very similar to the Intermediate Course.  The Course
Index contains a short introduction text and a table of contants.  The table of
contents starts with General Course Instructions, the 10 units, Answer Sheets
and Help Index.



== Organization of the Input Data ==

The basic LCG concept is based on files arranged into directories (folders)
according to the logical structure of the course.

There is one /base directory/ for the whole course.  This directory contains
one /subdirectory/ for each unit of the course.  Each of these subdirectories
contains files and subdirectories defining the content of the sections within
the unit.

The subdirectories can be named arbitrarily.  The only important thing is that
the units are ordered according to the alphabetical order of the names of their
directories.  Thus it is advisable to prefix the names by a number of the unit
and then any name describing the focus of the unit for better orientation.  The
diretory names never appear in the output.  They are only used for organization
of the input files.

*An example of the recommended naming scheme for the subdirectories:*

  * 01-telephoning
  * 02-office-admin
  * 03-financial
  * 04-hotels
  * 05-tourism
  * ...


Let's take a look into the course /base directory/ first and then we will
describe the contents of a unit directory.

=== Course-Wide data ===

The data format of each input file depends on the type of the content it is
used for.

Here is an overview of files needed for the whole course:

intro.txt
  A brief course introductory text for the base course page (the index page).
  The file format is the [data-formats#structured-text]

grammar.txt
  The data for the Grammar Bank as the [data-formats#structured-text].
  Obviously, this file is only needed for the Intermediate Course, since the
  Advanced Course has no Grammar Bank.  See the following section for more
  details about writing the Grammar Bank.

==== Notes for Writing the Grammar Bank ====

Within the contents of the Grammar Bank, there are often words or structures,
which can be considered citations.  They can be recognised easily: Even after
translating the grammar explanations into another language, these words or
structures will still remain in English (or German for the German course).

Example (with the citations in italics): 

The modal auxiliary verbs (>>can, could, must, may, might, shall, should, will,
would<<) have only one form.  There are also short affirmative forms for
>>shall<< (>>'ll<<) >>will<< (>>'ll<<) and >>would<< (>>'d<<)

The citations must be marked by surrounding them into double angle brackets
like this: =\>>word\<<=.  The paragraph above would be written like this:

-----
The modal auxiliary verbs (>>can, could, must, may, might, shall, should, will,
would<<) have only one form.  There are also short affirmative forms for
>>shall<< (>>'ll<<) >>will<< (>>'ll<<) and >>would<< (>>'d<<)
-----


=== Inside the Unit Directory ===


Here is an overview of files needed for each unit:

title.txt
  The content of this file determines the title of the unit.  This
  should be just one line of [data-formats#plain-text].

aims.txt
  Source for the "Aims and Objectives" section as
  [data-formats#structured-text].

vocabulary.txt
  The Vocabulary lists are only present in the Intermediate
  Course, so this file is not needed for the Advanced Course.  The file
  'vocabulary.txt' is the primary source of the vocabulary.  The creator of the
  course defines the terms here with empty translations first.  Then the
  translators make different translations of this file.  Each translation is
  stored in a different file as described in [#vocab-translations].

exercises.txt
  In the Intermediate Course, the file has five sections (corresponding to the
  five exericise sections defined above) separated by a line of four equation
  signs.  In the advanced course, the file uses section headers as described in
  the [data-formats#exercises].

checklist.txt
  Source for the "Checklist" section as [data-formats#structured-text].


See the description of each LCG data format for more datails about the contents
of the files.


== Translations ==

In general, all the translation data are plain text files.  You always download
the source file and edit it using your favorite text editor.  A simple editor,
such as Notepad should do the job.  The source files are UTF-8 encoded and this
encoding must be also preserved when saving them.

The text format is let's say the ``low level'' format.  There is, however, also
a higher level format imposed by the type of the content.  Specific rules allpy
to each file, depending on it's content:

@TOC@



=== Translating the Vocabulary === vocab-translations

All the vocabulary is stored in plain text files.  There is one file for each
unit and each target language.  In other words, one vocabulary file contains
vocabulary for one unit and one target language.

Initially only one vocabulary file per unit is created (the English/German one)
without translations.  Then, the translators add the translations into this
file and upload it to the source directory with a different filename.

The name of the initial vocabulary file (without translations) is
=vocabulary.txt=.  There must be one file of that name in each unit's source
directory.

The translation files are then named according to the following table:

| *Language* | *Filename*          | *Note* |
| Czech      | =vocabulary.cs.txt= || 
| English    | =vocabulary.en.txt= | for the German course only) |
| German     | =vocabulary.de.txt= | for the English course only) |
| Norwegian  | =vocabulary.no.txt= ||
| Slovak     | =vocabulary.sk.txt= ||
| Spanish    | =vocabulary.es.txt= ||

See the description of the [data-formats#vocabulary Vocabulary Data Format] for
more details about the contents of vocabulary files.


=== Translating the Stuctured Text === translating-structured-text

The text is formatted using a simple markup.  You should preserve the markup
when translating.  You will find a brief reference below and this is all you
need to know.  In general, you simply don't care about the markup too much.
You just edit the text and leave the markup untouched.

==== Brief Formatting Reference ====

 * Section headers are marked with equation signs surrounding the section
   title.  The identifier at the end of the heading line must be preserved (not
   translated).

 * Paragraphs are blocks of text separated with blank lines from each other.

 * References to English terms which should /NOT/ be translated are marked by
   double angle brackets.  For example in a sentence ``You can find a link
   named \>>Exercise Help\<< at the beginning of each exercise.'', the label
   ``Exercise Help'' must stay in English and you also leave the angle brackets
   where they are.  See also [#citations] for more details.

 * Hypertext links are marked by square brackets.  Something like
   [http://eurochance.brailcom.org Eurochance project homepage].  The link
   target (verything before the first space) must stay unchanged.  The link
   name (everything within the brackets after the first space) should be
   translated, when the link is not surrounded by double angle brackets.  Some
   links have no names (are named automatically), so there is nothing to
   translate.

 * Bullet lists are indented with spaces and each item starts with an asterisk
   (as in this text).

 * Lines which start with a hash (#) character are comments and must be left
   untouched.

That's mostly all.  More detailed manual can be found at
[data-formats#structured-text].  The example below illustrates these rules.


-----
 == Simple Example == example

 This is a paragraph of text.  This text belongs to a section named "Simple
 Example".  Simple text emphasizing can be done using /slashes for italics/ or
 *asterisks for bold*.  You should preserve these characters while translating.

 You definitely want to translate the section title "Simple Example", but you
 must leave the equation signs around the translation so the new title will be
 still recognized as section title.  The string 'example' at the end of the
 line is a section identifier.  It doesn't appear in the output document, but
 is used by the LCG internally to refer to a section.  Thus it must be
 preserved as is and not translated.

 Examples of hypertext links:

   * [#example] ... nothing to translate (#example is a link target and can not
     be changed).

   * [http:eurochance.brailcom.org Project Homepage] ... "Project Homepage" is
     a link name and should be translated.

   * >>[index Course Index]<< ... This is marked as citation, so should be left
     as is.

 The above list is an example of a bullet list.  You must preserve the asterisk
 at the beginning of each item and also the same amount of spaces at the
 beginning of each line (the indentation).

 # This line begins with a hash and thus it is a comment or a special control
 # directive.  You never touch comment lines and leave them in the translated
 # document.  They never appear in the output, but may be important for
 # processing.


-----


==== Citations ==== citations

The citations (marked by angle brackets) within the English course always mark
text which will stay in English.  In the German course, this is the text in
German.  Thus you don't translate what's inside.

Citations are used in the following cases:

    * English/German sentence or expression which is a subject of some
      explanation (mostly within the Grammar Bank).  Quite obviously, we could
      not teach English without using English expressions and sentences.

    * English/German label or text, which is a part of the User Interface and
      appears in English/German in the resulting course.  Thus references to
      such User Interface elements must stay in the language in which they
      appear in the course, so that the user knows what we are talking about.

Sometimes it might be appropriate to add a translation of the cited text (for
example in parenthesis after this text, when the meaning might not be obvious
from the context.  This can often happen in the Grammar Bank.

Also in General Course Instructions the meaning of the referenced English label
might not be obvious.  Thus, for example, ``the \>>Grammar Bank\<<'' can be
translated as ``un \>>Grammar Bank\<< (base de datos gramatical)'' into
Spanish.


== Sound Recordings == recordings

=== Sound File Format ===

All sounds should be recorded digitally in the WAVe format with CD quality.
This means in particular:

  * Two channels (stereo)
  * Sampling frequency 44.1 kHz
  * 16 bits per sample.

These source data will be converted into an applicable output format in
reasonable quality by the technical group.

=== Segmentation ===

Each logical piece should be recorded as a separate file except for vocabulary,
since recording one very short file per one vocab item would be too difficult
and time consuming.

Vocabulary should be recorded into one file per unit.  There should be distinct
pauses between individual vocabulary items (one or two seconds).  These
recordings will be cut into pieces automatically.

All other recordings should be recorded separately -- one file per logical
unit.  For instance there will be one file for each listening exercise etc.

=== Delivery of the Recorded Data ===

The data should be burned on a CD when ready and sent to the technical group,
since it will be probably too large for transmission via the Internet.

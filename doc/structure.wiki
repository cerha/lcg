This document describes the course structure for Eurochance language courses.

Table of Contents: @TOC@

== Overview ==

A course consists of a certain number of units (for instance 15 units for
the Intermediate course).  Each unit is focused on certain topic (e.g. finance,
catering etc.).

Each unit consists of several sections:

  * *Aims and Objectives* ... outline of the focus of the unit
  * *Vocabulary* ... vocabulary listing
  * *Grammar* ... a very basic explanation
  * *Exercises* ... series of exercises to practise the acquired knowledge
  * *Checklist* ... an overview of competences achieved in the unit

== Types of Content ==

=== Aims and Objectives ===

This introduction section consists of a structured text.  This means paragraphs
of text with simple formatting (text emphasizing, itemized lists etc.).

=== Vocabulary ===

Consists of a listing of vocabulary for the unit.  User can read each piece of
vocabulary separately, hear the correct pronounciation (recorded by native
speaker) and read the translation into his mother tongue.

User can browse the vocabulary up and down and search for a concrete word
(by the means of the browser).

=== Key Grammar ===

This is another structured text section.  Multiple sections should be used to
allow direct access to certain parts from the Table of Contents and the Grammar
Index.

=== Exercises ===

This section consists of a series of exercises.  There is a predefined set of
exercise types that can be used.  The order and number of exercises does not
matter as long as the types are respected, however it is advisable to stick to
cartain convention for beter users orientation.

The detailed description of exercise types and their content can be found at
the [manual.html|Language Content Generator manual].

=== Consolidation ===

This is a short section of structured text.  Most often this will be an
itemised list of the competences achieved in the unit.

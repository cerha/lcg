== Organization of the Input Data ==

The basic LCG concept is based on files arranged into directories (folders)
according to the logical structure of the course.

There is one /base directory/ for the whole course.  This directory contains
one /subdirectory/ for each unit of the course.  Each of these subdirectories
contains files and subdirectories defining the content of the sections within
the unit.

The subdirectories can be named arbitrarily.  The only important thing is that
the units are ordered according to the alphabetical order of the names of their
directories.  Thus it is advisable to prefix the names by a number of the unit
and then any name describing the focus of the unit for better orientation.  The
diretory names never appear in the output.  They are only used for organization
of the input files.

*An example of the recommended naming scheme for the subdirectories:*

  * 01-telephoning
  * 02-office-admin
  * 03-financial
  * 04-hotels
  * 05-tourism
  * ...


Let's take a look into the course /base directory/ first and then we will
describe the contents of a unit directory.

=== Course-Wide data ===

The data format of each input file depends on the type of the content it is
used for.

Here is an overview of files needed for the whole course:

intro.txt
  A brief course introductory text for the base course page (the index page).
  The file format is the [structured-text]

grammar.txt
  The data for the Grammar Bank as the [structured-text].  Obviously, this file
  is only needed for the Intermediate Course, since the Advanced Course has no
  Grammar Bank.  See also [#notes-grammar] for specific advice on using the
  generic constructs of the structured text format within the Grammar Bank.


=== Inside the Unit Directory ===


Here is an overview of files needed for each unit:

title.txt
  The content of this file determines the title of the unit.  This
  should be just one line of [plain-text].

aims.txt
  Source for the "Aims and Objectives" section as
  [structured-text].

vocabulary.txt
  The Vocabulary lists are only present in the Intermediate
  Course, so this file is not needed for the Advanced Course.  The file
  'vocabulary.txt' is the primary source of the vocabulary.  The creator of the
  course defines the terms here with empty translations first.  Then the
  translators make different translations of this file.  Each translation is
  stored in a different file as described in [eurochance-translations#vocab].

exercises.txt
  In the Intermediate Course, the file has five sections (corresponding to the
  five exericise sections defined above) separated by a line of four equation
  signs.  In the advanced course, the file uses section headers as described in
  the [exercises].

checklist.txt
  Source for the "Checklist" section as [structured-text].


=== Notes for Writing the Grammar Bank === notes-grammar

Within the contents of the Grammar Bank, there are often words or structures,
which can be considered citations.  They can be recognised easily: Even after
translating the grammar explanations into another language, these words or
structures will still remain in English (or German for the German course).

Example (with the citations in italics): 

The modal auxiliary verbs (>>can, could, must, may, might, shall, should, will,
would<<) have only one form.  There are also short affirmative forms for
>>shall<< (>>'ll<<) >>will<< (>>'ll<<) and >>would<< (>>'d<<)

The citations must be marked by surrounding them into double angle brackets
like this: =\>>word\<<=.  The paragraph above would be written like this:

-----
The modal auxiliary verbs (>>can, could, must, may, might, shall, should, will,
would<<) have only one form.  There are also short affirmative forms for
>>shall<< (>>'ll<<) >>will<< (>>'ll<<) and >>would<< (>>'d<<)

=== Notes for Writing the Exercise files === notes-exercises

Many exercise types use [structured-text] to format the exercise texts.  Here
are a few practical tips how to use the structured text constructs within the
exercises.

Many exercises are based on a conversation.  These conversations may be written
as [structured-text#field-sets].  Speaker's name must start the line and is
enclosed in colons from both sides.  The spoken text follows.  When split over
multiple lines, all the subsequent lines must be indented, until the next
speaker name appears.

*Example:*

------
:Granny: I thought you told me you'd already made up your mind to do
         accountancy.
:Emma:   I don't know. There are all kinds of other work in finance and I'm not
         sure accounting would be too exciting.
:Granny: Exciting? What you need is a good steady job and a good steady
         boyfriend, my girl. Take my word for it.  Do your accounting course
         then find a good job round here instead of traipsing off to the big
         city. And here's your cup of tea.
:Emma:   Oh, thanks. But Granny, there's more to life than getting married and
	 having babies. And I want to see a bit of the world before I
	 settle down. I've been thinking about private banking ...

This will be presented as:

== Sound Recordings == recordings

=== Sound File Format ===

All sounds should be recorded digitally in the WAVe format with CD quality.
This means in particular:

  * Two channels (stereo)
  * Sampling frequency 44.1 kHz
  * 16 bits per sample.

These source data will be converted into an applicable output format in
reasonable quality by the technical group.

=== Segmentation ===

Each logical piece should be recorded as a separate file except for vocabulary,
since recording one very short file per one vocab item would be too difficult
and time consuming.

Vocabulary should be recorded into one file per unit.  There should be distinct
pauses between individual vocabulary items (one or two seconds).  These
recordings will be cut into pieces automatically.

All other recordings should be recorded separately -- one file per logical
unit.  For instance there will be one file for each listening exercise etc.

=== Delivery of the Recorded Data ===

The data should be burned on a CD when ready and sent to the technical group,
since it will be probably too large for transmission via the Internet.

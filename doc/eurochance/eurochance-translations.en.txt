== Translations ==

In general, all the translation data are plain text files.  You always download
the source file and edit it using your favorite text editor.  A simple editor,
such as Notepad should do the job.  The source files are UTF-8 encoded and this
encoding must be also preserved when saving them.

The text format is let's say the ``low level'' format.  There is, however, also
a higher level format imposed by the type of the content.  Specific rules allpy
to each file, depending on it's content:

=== Translating the Vocabulary === vocab

All the vocabulary is stored in plain text files.  There is one file for each
unit and each target language.  In other words, one vocabulary file contains
vocabulary for one unit and one target language.

Initially only one vocabulary file per unit is created (the English/German one)
without translations.  Then, the translators add the translations into this
file and upload it to the source directory with a different filename.

The name of the initial vocabulary file (without translations) is
=vocabulary.txt=.  There must be one file of that name in each unit's source
directory.

The translation files are then named according to the following table:

| *Language* | *Filename*          | *Note* |
| Czech      | =vocabulary.cs.txt= || 
| English    | =vocabulary.en.txt= | for the German course only) |
| German     | =vocabulary.de.txt= | for the English course only) |
| Norwegian  | =vocabulary.no.txt= ||
| Slovak     | =vocabulary.sk.txt= ||
| Spanish    | =vocabulary.es.txt= ||

See the description of the [vocabulary Vocabulary Data Format] for
more details about the contents of vocabulary files.


=== Translating the Stuctured Text === translating-structured-text

The text is formatted using a simple markup.  You should preserve the markup
when translating.  You will find a brief reference below and this is all you
need to know.  In general, you simply don't care about the markup too much.
You just edit the text and leave the markup untouched.

==== Brief Formatting Reference ====

 * Section headers are marked with equation signs surrounding the section
   title.  The identifier at the end of the heading line must be preserved (not
   translated).

 * Paragraphs are blocks of text separated with blank lines from each other.

 * References to English terms which should /NOT/ be translated are marked by
   double angle brackets.  For example in a sentence ``You can find a link
   named \>>Exercise Help\<< at the beginning of each exercise.'', the label
   ``Exercise Help'' must stay in English and you also leave the angle brackets
   where they are.  See also [#citations] for more details.

 * Hypertext links are marked by square brackets.  Something like
   [http://eurochance.brailcom.org Eurochance project homepage].  The link
   target (verything before the first space) must stay unchanged.  The link
   name (everything within the brackets after the first space) should be
   translated, when the link is not surrounded by double angle brackets.  Some
   links have no names (are named automatically), so there is nothing to
   translate.

 * Bullet lists are indented with spaces and each item starts with an asterisk
   (as in this text).

 * Lines which start with a hash (#) character are comments and must be left
   untouched.

That's mostly all.  More detailed manual can be found at
[structured-text].  The example below illustrates these rules.


-----
 == Simple Example == example

 This is a paragraph of text.  This text belongs to a section named "Simple
 Example".  Simple text emphasizing can be done using /slashes for italics/ or
 *asterisks for bold*.  You should preserve these characters while translating.

 You definitely want to translate the section title "Simple Example", but you
 must leave the equation signs around the translation so the new title will be
 still recognized as section title.  The string 'example' at the end of the
 line is a section identifier.  It doesn't appear in the output document, but
 is used by the LCG internally to refer to a section.  Thus it must be
 preserved as is and not translated.

 Examples of hypertext links:

   * [#example] ... nothing to translate (#example is a link target and can not
     be changed).

   * [http:eurochance.brailcom.org Project Homepage] ... "Project Homepage" is
     a link name and should be translated.

   * >>[index Course Index]<< ... This is marked as citation, so should be left
     as is.

 The above list is an example of a bullet list.  You must preserve the asterisk
 at the beginning of each item and also the same amount of spaces at the
 beginning of each line (the indentation).

 # This line begins with a hash and thus it is a comment or a special control
 # directive.  You never touch comment lines and leave them in the translated
 # document.  They never appear in the output, but may be important for
 # processing.

==== Citations ==== citations

The citations (marked by angle brackets) within the English course always mark
text which will stay in English.  In the German course, this is the text in
German.  Thus you don't translate what's inside.

Citations are used in the following cases:

    * English/German sentence or expression which is a subject of some
      explanation (mostly within the Grammar Bank).  Quite obviously, we could
      not teach English without using English expressions and sentences.

    * English/German label or text, which is a part of the User Interface and
      appears in English/German in the resulting course.  Thus references to
      such User Interface elements must stay in the language in which they
      appear in the course, so that the user knows what we are talking about.

Sometimes it might be appropriate to add a translation of the cited text (for
example in parenthesis after this text, when the meaning might not be obvious
from the context.  This can often happen in the Grammar Bank.

Also in General Course Instructions the meaning of the referenced English label
might not be obvious.  Thus, for example, ``the \>>Grammar Bank\<<'' can be
translated as ``un \>>Grammar Bank\<< (base de datos gramatical)'' into
Spanish.

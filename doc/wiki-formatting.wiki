= Wiki Formatting Manual =

 
This document describes the Wiki markup used by the
[http://www.freebsoft.org/lcg|LCG Wiki Formatter].

Table of contents: @TOC@


== Basics ==

Wiki uses simple conventions to mark the logical structure of a text document
as well as some text properties.  The advantage is that the document source
stays easily readable and editable without any particular tool.  Just a simple
text editor can do the job.

=== Text Emphasizing ===

You can use *Bold text*, /italic text/, _underlined text_, =fixed font=,
/*or their _combinations_*/.

The source code for the paragraph above looks like:

-----
You can use *Bold text*, /italic text/, _underlined text_, =fixed font=,
/*or their _combinations_*/.
-----


=== Escaping ===

You can avoid the special meaning of all the constructs described in this
document by prefixing them by the exclamation mark.

*Example:*

------
Slashes are used for /italic/, however sometimes you want just the slash like
in GNU!/Linux.
------

This renders as:

Slashes are used for /italic/, however sometimes you want just the slash like
in GNU!/Linux.


=== Paragraphs ===

A paragraph is each continual set of rows of text.  Whenever you leave a blank
line, you start a new paragraph.  The line-breaks within the paragraph are
ignored, since the paragraph will be reformatted to fit the output media
(i.e. browser window).


=== Links === links

Link is marked by square brackets.  The text in the brackets is the link
target.  The link name can be optionally included after the link target,
separated with a pipe '|' character.

*Example:*

------
Visit [http://www.gnu.org|GNU].  See also [#anchors].
------

This renders as:

Visit [http://www.gnu.org|GNU].  See also [#anchors].

Link names are automatically supplied for links to local anchors within the
document (see [#anchors]) and also for links to other wiki documents when the
generator implements this feature.

External links beginning with '!http://', such as http://www.freebsoft.org, are
recognized automatically, so the square brackets are not necessary.  Also
e-mail addresses automatically become links.


=== Images ===

Any link pointing to an image will display the image in-line.

*Example:*

------
http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif
------

This renders as:

http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif



== Structure ==

The main strength of the LCG wiki formatter is the recognition of the logical
structure within the document.  This structure is based on the hierarchy of
sections.

The knowledge of the structure is than used to allow the advanced features,
such as [#anchors] and [#toc].

=== Section Headings ===

Section headings are marked by equation characters at the beginning and end of
the line.  The text between the equation signs is a section title.  The number
of the equation signs determines the level.

All the text below the heading belongs to the section of that name until
another section heading is found.

*Example:*

------
 == This is the main heading ==

 The paragraphs below belong to the first section.

 === Subsection Heading ===

 This paragraph belongs to the subsection of the first section.

 == A second section ==

 This is a second section on the same level as the first one.
----- 

It is /important/ to /separate/ the equation marks from the heading text (using
a space) and to /avoid/ any other (even blank) characters after the final
equation sign.


=== Anchors === anchors

Additionally an anchor name can be defined for each heading.  The anchor can
consist of alpha-numerical characters, underscores and dashes and is written
at the end of the heading line separated with at least one blank character
(space).

-----
 == Introduction == intro
-----

An anchor can be used to refer to the section.  The link ![#intro], for
example, will be rendered as [#intro|Introduction] (see [#links] for more
details).


=== Tables of Contents === toc

Table of contents is a hierarchical list of all sections within a document or
it's part.  It can be included in the document using the '=@TOC@=' macro.

*Example:*

-----
Table of Contents: @TOC@
-----

This source line will be replaced with the table of contents.  The text before
the colon is used for the caption and the TOC includes all the subsections of
the section, within which the macro is used.  This means you can also create local tables of contents
in particular subsections.

The TOC at the top of this manual is made the same way.


== Advanced Constructs ==

=== Itemized Lists ===

Itemized lists are marked by an asterisk at the beginning of each item.  Each
item is indented by a space.

*Example:*

------
 * cats
 * dogs
 * frogs
------

This renders as:

 * cats
 * dogs
 * frogs

Ordered lists can be made using a number with a period instead of an asterisk.
The numbers in the source document are ignored, since the output numbers are
generated.  This means that you are free to mark all items with zero for
example or you can use real order numbers if you prefer.

*Example:*

------
 0. cats
 0. dogs
 0. frogs

or:

 1. mice
 2. rats
 3. bats
------

This renders as:

 0. cats
 0. dogs
 0. frogs

or:

 1. mice
 2. rats
 3. bats

Similarly, alpha-ordered lists can be made:

------
 a. cats
 b. dogs
 c. frogs
------

This renders as:

 a. cats
 b. dogs
 c. frogs


=== Preformatted Text === preformatted-text

You can mark a block of text as a preformatted text by surrounding it by lines
of five or more dashes.

No further formatting is then applied to the preformatted text.  It is rendered
as it appears in the source document.

*Example:*

------
 ------
  foo   bar
   x     y
   1     2
 ------
------

This renders as:

------
 foo   bar
  x     y
  1     2
------

All the examples in this manual are written as preformatted text.




=== Tables ===

You can make simple tables with constant number of cells per row.  Each row in
on one line and pipe characters are used to separate the cells.  The line must
also begin and end with a pipe character.


*Example:*

------
|        | Dick   | Jane |
| height | 72"    | 65"  |
| weight | 130lbs | 150lbs |
------

|        | Dick   | Jane |
| height | 72"    | 65"  |
| weight | 130lbs | 150lbs |


== Other Features ==


=== Special and Typographical Characters ===


==== Non-breakable Space ====

The line-breaks are inserted automatically, when the paragraph is formatted to
fit the output media.  However, you sometimes don't want a line-break in a
certain place.  You can use a tilde character '=!~=' instead of a space in such
cases.

*Example:*

------
We can forbid a line-break between the first and second name of
Richard~Stallman, but we must prefix the tilde with an exclamation sign, when
we need to write the shell command =cd !~=.
------

This renders as:

We can forbid a line-break between the first and second name of
Richard~Stallman, but we must prefix the tilde with an exclamation sign, when
we need to write the shell command '=cd !~='.


==== Long Dash ====

Double dash (two minus signs) produce a long dash on the output

*Example:*

------
LCG -- highway to excellence.
------

This renders as:

LCG -- highway to excellence.

==== Double Quotes ====

Double quotes begin with two reverse apostrophes and end with two single
apostrophes.

*Example:*

------
He said: ``Who knows?''
------

This renders as:

He said: ``Who knows?''


=== Horizontal Lines ===

Horizontal line can be made with 4 dashes on a separate line.

*Example:*

------
----
------

This renders as:

----

=== Comments ===

You can comment out any text with '# ' at the beginning of a line.  This will
make the text invisible on output media (e.g. by making it an HTML comment in
the HTML output):

------
  # These lines have been 
  # commented out
------

This renders as nothing:

# These lines have been 
# commented out

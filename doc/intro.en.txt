= Introduction =

The LCG is a computer program designed to process structured textual and
multimedia data and produce their output presentation in one of the supported
output formats.  LCG is highly modular and many of its components may be used
independently as Python libraries.

LCG stands for Learning Content Generator, since it was initially developed to
generate e-learning courses, but the current use is much wider, so we don't
refer to it by the full name to prevent missunderstanding.

LCG supports /multimedia/ and /interactive/ content and /accessibility/ is one
of the major concerns, with a special attention to users of screen-readers and
other assistive technologies.

The input data formats were designed to allow content creation without the need
for any particular software or tool and to be easy to understand and edit even
for non-technicians.

One of the key points is a total /separation/ of the /input data/ and their
/output presentation/.  Thus it is easy to change the appearance and user
interface of the generated output without any changes in the source data.  This
proved to be very useful when customizing the interactive user interfaces to
different output formats and for different target groups (e.g. people with
various handicaps or using special technologies).

LCG recognizes the structure of the data, with support for simple generic
elements, such as /paragraphs, sections, bullet lists, tables/ as well as more
advanced and quite specialized constructs, such as /interactive exercises/
(multiple choice, fill-in texts, dictations).

LCG also handles documents in /multiple languages/ correctly.  It is able to
manage several language versions of one document, as well as intermix more
languages in one document.

The following output formats are currently supported:
  * Static HTML (a set of hyperlinked pages)
  * IMS content package (for use within a Learning Management System)
  * HTML Help Workshop (format used by many help viewers)

LCG is a /Free Software/ distributed under the terms of GNU General Public
License.

= Introduction =

The Learning Content Generator (LCG) is a computer program, which processes the
input data and produces a Content Package (CP) that can be used in an on-line
or off-line learning environment. 

== The Goals ==

 * The input data formats must allow creating the content without the need for
   any particular software or tool.  

 * The input data formats must be easy to understand and edit even for
   non-technicians.

 * It must be easy to change the appearance and user interface of the generated
   CP without any changes in the input data.

 * It must be possible to generate the output in different formats.  Initially
   the IMS content package and a set of static web pages must be supported.

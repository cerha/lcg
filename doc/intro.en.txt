The Learning Content Generator (LCG) is a computer program designed to process
structured textual and multimedia data and produce an output presentation which
is suitable for use in an on-line or off-line learning environment.

The term ``learning environment'' should be understood as general as it stands.
Currently the following output formats are supported:

  * Static HTML (a set of hyperlinked pages for off-line use)
  * IMS content package (for use within a Learning Management System)
  * HTML Help Workshop (format used by many help viewers)

LCG supports /multimedia/ and /interactive/ content and /accessibility/ is one
of the major concerns, with a special attention to blind users, since this was
the original target group, for which the product was developed.

The input data formats were designed to allow content creation without the need
for any particular software or tool and to be easy to understand and edit even
for non-technicians.

One of the key points is a total /separation/ of the /input data/ and their
/output presentation/.  Thus it is easy to change the appearance and user
interface of the generated output without any changes in the source data.  This
proved to be very useful when customizing the interactive user interfaces to
different output formats and for different target groups (e.g. people with
various handicaps or using special technologies).

LCG recognizes the structure of the data, with support for simple generic
elements, such as /paragraphs, sections, bullet lists, tables/ as well as more
advanced and quite specialized constructs, such as /interactive exercises/
(multiple choice, fill-in texts, dictations).

LCG also handles documents in /multiple languages/ correctly.  It is able to
manage several language versions of one document, as well as intermix more
languages in one document.

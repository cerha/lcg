= Introduction =

The Learning Content Generator (LCG) is a computer program designed to process
structured textual data and multimedia files and produce their output
presentation, suitable for use in an on-line or off-line learning environment.

The term ``learning environment'' should be considered as general as it sounds,
ranging from an on-line Learning Management System, to a printed document which
can be studied independently.

== The Goals ==

 * The input data formats must allow creating the content without the need for
   any particular software or tool.

 * The input data formats must be easy to understand and edit even for
   non-technicians.

 * It must be possible to include multimedia and interactive content.

 * The input data must be totally independent of the output presentation.  It
   must be easy to change the appearance and user interface of the generated
   output without any changes in the input data.

 * It must be possible to generate the output in different formats.  Initially
   an IMS content package and a set of static web pages must be supported.

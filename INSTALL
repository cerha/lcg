Learning Content Generator Installation Instructions

Dependencies:

  * You need Python 2.3 or later to run LCG.  

The simplest installation can be done using the provided Makefile.  Just run
`make install' within the package's root directory.  Feel free to edit the
Makefile and setup your own installation paths.  Apparently, you need to have
GNU make on your system to do that.

There is also an alternative installation, which allows you to run LCG directly
from a CVS checkout directory (it doesn't make much sense from a release
pakage).  The advantage is that you will be able to check out a newer version
at any time and this new version will be used automatically.  If you prefer
this, run `make cvs-install'.  To update your installation from CVS anytime
later, run `make cvs-update' (which also rebuilds your locale data
automatically).  You need a GNU gettext package to be able to do that.  Beware,
that running CVS code is in general risky and is not recommended in production
environment.

The third option is not to install anything at all.  You just setup your
environment to find LCG, wherever it is.  This might become handy when you, for
example, don't have write access to the system wide library path etc.  Let's
suppose that you have unpacked LCG to `/home/bob/lcg'.

  1. Tell Python where to find the libraries:

     $ export PYTHONPATH=/home/bob/lcg/lib

  2. Tell LCG where to find its data:

     $ export LCGDIR=/home/bob/lcg

  3. If you checked LCG out from CVS, you should also run `make translations'.
     This step can be omitted if you downloaded an LCG release package.

  4. If you need to use LCG executables, such as `lcgmake', just use their full
     path.  You will find them in the `bin' subdirectory.

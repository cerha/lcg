Learning Content Generator Installation


You need Python 2.3 or later to run LCG.  After downloading the package, you
must add the LCG Python libraries somewhere to your Python path.  There are
several ways to do that and it depends on your preference.  You may for example
add the `lib' directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable or link the
directory `lib/lcg' from your package installation directory to your site
packages directory (eg. `/usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages').

If you downloaded LCG directly form CVS, you will also need to generate the
locale data by running `make translations' in the package root directory.
Obviously, you need to have GNU make on your system to do that.  If you
downloaded a released version, you can omit this step.

Finally you need to make LCG see it's resource files and translation data.
Again, you have several choices.  The simplest way is to set the environment
variable LCGDIR to your installation directory (where you unpacked the
package).  LCG will search for the subdirectories `resources' and
`translations' there.  The other option is to link these two directories from
your installation directory to `/usr/local/share/lcg', which is the default
LCGDIR.

You should be all set now.  Try running `make test' (or `./lib/lcg/_test.py' if
you don't have make).

You may also want to generate LCG documentation by running `make doc'.

If you want to use LCG directly, you will probably also link the script
`bin/lcgmake.py' somewhere to `/usr/local/bin'.

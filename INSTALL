Learning Content Generator Installation Instructions

Dependencies:

  * You need Python 2.3 or later to run LCG.  

The simplest installation can be done using the provided Makefile.  Just run
"make && make install" within the package root directory.  Feel free to
edit the Makefile and setup your own installation paths.

You can also run the development version directly out of your checked out tree,
being able to check out a newer version at any time and using this new version
right away.  The Makefile supports this setup by linking the necessary
directories into your checked out tree.  You need to run "make && make
install-links" for the first time, and then just "make all" after each
checkout.

The third option is not to install anything at all.  You just setup your
environment to find LCG, wherever it is.  This might become handy when you, for
example, don't have write access to the system wide library path etc.  Let's
suppose that you have unpacked LCG to `/home/bob/lcg'.

  1. Tell Python where to find the libraries:

     $ export PYTHONPATH=/home/bob/lcg/lib

  2. Tell LCG where to find its data:

     $ export LCGDIR=/home/bob/lcg

  3. If you checked LCG out from CVS, you should also run `make translations'.
     This step can be omitted if you downloaded an LCG release package.

  4. If you need to use LCG executables, such as `lcgmake', just use their full
     path.  You will find them in the `bin' subdirectory.

Learning Content Generator Installation Instructions

You need Python 2.3 or later to run LCG.  

The simplest installation can be done using the provided Makefile.  Just run
"make install" within the package root directory.  Feel free to edit the
Makefile and setup your own installation paths.

You can also setup LCG manually.  This is recommended when you checked LCG out
of CVS and want to run the CVS version directly.  You will be able to check out
a newer version at any time and this new version will be used automatically.
The commands mentioned below should all be run from within the package root
directory.

The procedure has the following steps:
	
  1. Generate locale data.
  2. Add LCG Python libraries somewhere to your Python path.
  3. Install LCG shared data to a known place.
  4. Install the user tools (optional)


== Generate locale data ==

If you downloaded LCG directly form CVS, you will need to generate locale data.
If you downloaded a released version, you can omit this step.  If you plan to
update your installation from CVS, you will need to repeat this step after each
update.  Run the following command to generate the locale data:

 $ make translations

Obviously, you need to have GNU make on your system to do that.  Apart from
make, you also need the GNU gettext package.


== Add LCG libraries to your Python path ==

The recommended approach is to link the library to your site packages
directory.  On a typical unix/linux system this can be:

 $ ln -s `pwd`/lib/lcg /usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/lcg

Replace `python2.4' with the Python version you use.

Alternatively, you may add lcg to your PYTHONPATH environment variable:

 $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/lib


== Install LCG shared data ==

It is recommended to link (or copy) the shared directories to
`/usr/local/share/lcg' as follows:

 $ mkdir /usr/local/share/lcg
 $ ln -s `pwd`/doc `pwd`/translations `pwd`/resources /usr/local/share/lcg/

If this is not possible, set the environment variable LCGDIR to your
LCG installation directory before using LCG:

 $ export LCGDIR=`pwd`

== Install user tools ==

If you want to use LCG directly, you will probably also link the script
`bin/lcgmake.py' somewhere to your path.   For example:
 
 $ ln -s `pwd`/bin/lcgmake.py /usr/local/bin/lcgmake

Learning Content Generator Installation Instructions

You need Python 2.3 or later to run LCG.  

The following instructions assume, that you have downloaded LCG and unpacked it
somewhere on your system.  We will refer to the unpacked directory as `the
installation directory'.  All the mentioned commands should be run from within
this directory.

First you need to add the LCG Python libraries somewhere to your Python path.
The recommended approach is to link the library to your site packages
directory.  On a typical unix/linux system this can be:

 $ ln -s `pwd`/lib/lcg /usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages/lcg

Replace `python2.3' with the Python version you use.

Alternatively, you may add lcg to your PYTHONPATH environment variable:

 $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/lib

Now you need to make LCG resource files and translation data visible to LCG.
It is recommended to link (or copy) them to `/usr/local/share/lcg' directory as
follows:

 $ mkdir /usr/local/share/lcg
 $ ln -s `pwd`/translations `pwd`/resources /usr/local/share/lcg/

If this is not possible, set the environment variable LCGDIR to your
installation directory before using LCG:

 $ export LCGDIR=`pwd`

If you downloaded LCG directly form CVS, you will also need to generate the
locale data by running:

 $ make translations

Obviously, you need to have GNU make on your system to do that.  Apart from
make, you also need the GNU gettext package.  If you downloaded a released
version, you can omit this step.

You should be all set now.  Try running `make test' (or `./lib/lcg/_test.py' if
you don't have make).

You may also want to generate LCG documentation by running:

 $ make doc

If you want to use LCG directly, you will probably also link the script
`bin/lcgmake.py' somewhere to your path.
 
 $ ln -s `pwd`/bin/lcgmake.py /usr/local/bin/lcgmake

Note, that the recommended symlinked configuration is good when you checked LCG
out of CVS.  In this case you can check out a newer version at any time and no
further effort is needed to start using it.

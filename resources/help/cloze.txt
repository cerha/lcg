The recording here is the first or second half of the listening text in
Exercise 1.  You can listen to it either before or after doing the exercise, or
both, in order to hear the human pronunciation and intonation again.

Your goal in this exercise is to fill in the gaps in the text using
exactly the same words as you've heard in the recording.

After filling all the gaps, check your results using the buttons below the
text.  The evaluate button moves the cursor to the first incorrect answer, if
an error is found (and the cursor is moved to the first incorrect character, in
case that some part of the answer is correct).

== Shortcut keys == keys

Press the *'Enter'* key within the text-field and the answer will be evaluated.
You hear a sound response and in case of an error, the cursor is moved to the
position of the first incorrect character within the text.

If you don't know the answer, you can also use the ``hint'' feature.  Just
press the *'Ctrl-Space'* key combination (holding the Ctrl key, press the
spacebar) and one letter of the correct answer will be filled in automatically.
If you have already entered some text, the cursor will be moved behind the last
correct character and next one will be inserted.  After using the hint, you can
think once more what the correct answer is.  You will probably do some more
editing and try to evaluate or use the hint again, until you find the correct
answer.

Listen to the recording and type what you hear into the large text box below.
You can replay the recording how many times you need to understand it, however
two attempts should be enough for a well performing student.

Pay special attention to punctuation and case, since they often cause most of
the problems when evaluating dictation.  Write all the sentences as you hear

in the [instructions-cloze.html#keys|Cloze].

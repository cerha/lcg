General:

  * Better infrastructure for language versions (one instance generates all
    available language versions).

User interface:

  * Generate transcripts in HTML (page titles etc.)
  * Bookmark support.
  * Fill-in exercises: Trimming the texts?
  * Exposed cloze might support navigation between the tasks and the list.
  * MSIE scrolls to the top of the page when the focus is moved to a relatively
    positioned element (this doesn't matter for a blind user).
